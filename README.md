# Bash Scripts

A collection of Bash scripts that I've written, tweaked, or borrowed. Mostly unrelated, they're intended for a variety of tasks, from server maintenance to minor automation.

## Contents

### Current Scripts

- **p4proxy-cache-clean.sh**: Helps control disk space usage on a Perforce proxy server by purging old files from the cache.

### Future Scripts

The repository will eventually contain a mix of scripts that serve different purposes, such as:
- Automation tasks for server management
- Utility scripts for everyday file and system operations
- Scripts for interacting with cloud services (e.g., AWS)

## Usage

Each script will include its own usage information as a comment at the top of the script.

## Contributing

These scripts are provided as-is, but if you have suggestions, improvements, or notice any issues, please do open an issue or submit a pull request. I welcome contributions and feedback.

## Disclaimer

Use these scripts at your own risk. Always make sure you understand what a script does before running it, especially when dealing with file deletions or server operations.

Thanks for visiting this repository! I hope you find some of these scripts useful. If you find them primitive, I apologize. I'm always learning, so I'm sure that every one of these could be better... and hopefully, over time, they will be.
